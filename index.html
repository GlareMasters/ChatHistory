							at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able
							to enjoy and maximize it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be
							out with at least 1 month interval so players can play with it longer.
							Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
							<br>
							Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features
							like dungeons, alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc
							to be more relevant and useful for everyone. Payouts or rewards must
							commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the upgrades.<br>
							<br>
							Major SH releases:<br>
							June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem
							preset, Paladin of Sola Gear<br>
							<br>
							July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores
							(Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus, Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts,
							Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
							<br>
							August - Graveyard upgrade<br>
							<br>
							September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
							<br>
							October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							Business Effect:<br>
							Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the
							upgrades are lost business. They are mostly players spending in the game
							regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means longer revenue from
							that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Cost<br>
							The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling
							the burnt in their pockets. This too discourages players. If only
							upgrades would require just a couple of packs instead of 10s or 100s
							pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
							more active<br>
							<br>
							b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
							&gt;Lags<br>
							Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which
							annoy players, especially during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where
							lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play smoothly, it also
							costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
							eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up,
							multiple buttons in joining rallies, etc.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Glitches<br>
							Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months
							such as tile porting, heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on
							and off VIP, etc. These glitches are irritating and at the same times
							costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example, to VIP 24
							only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;App Crash<br>
							Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally
							eliminated.<br>
							<br>
							Business effect:<br>
							If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The
							more active the game is, the more revenue for MZ as players will
							purchase items they need for the event.<br>
							<br>
							c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
							&gt;More responsive<br>
							Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address
							concerns. Sadly, many mails are ignored for days. Mails must be answered
							within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner service agent.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Quality of response<br>
							Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate
							players in full who suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a
							fraction of what was lost actually just give a feeling of insults or
							irritates players.<br>
							<br>
							d. EVENTS<br>
							&gt;Interval and duration<br>
							Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it
							only happens every 2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making
							it more frequent like weekly and in longer duration like 24hrs to cover
							players from different timezones<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Coliseum events<br>
							Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought
							with gold, loyalty points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for
							different power levels must be returned so that even small players can
							enjoy the event.<br>
							<br>
							Business Effect:<br>
							Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for
							kvk. Giving more events will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
							<br>
							e. PACKS<br>
							&gt;Content<br>
							Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most
							packs are outdated. Items that are in demand and highly needed are often
							than not absent in packs. Why not remove chests and items that are
							outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing orbs,
							heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Price<br>
							Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger
							pack.<br>
							<br>
							f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
							&gt;Drops<br>
							Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or
							materials that are new and in demand.<br>
							<br>
							OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
							&gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
							The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made
							useful. The bazaar in particular should enable players to trade items
							between themselves. Copper should be varying or increasing. Items that
							can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
							should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock,
							instant execution, etc.<br>
							<br>
							-There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP
							pts. And the likes; 2) combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and
							other boosts.<br>
							<br>
							-Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom
							if it is staying for more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
							<br>
							-Alliance tile<br>
							Bring back the good gifts from alliance tiles as players spend on cores
							and troops to defend it.<br>

							💋💋αηɡεʆα💋💋: 🚨Boycott Update🚨<br>
							<br>
							A spending boycott is planned to go into effect on Sunday, October 23 at
							midnight PST.<br>
							<br>
							The initial boycott will last for 2 days (48 hours). We will keep
							everyone informed of the progress in opening a channel for discussion
							with MZ. If need be, we may have further boycotting to drive home our
							stance on our topics.<br>
							<br>
							Please help us spread the word as quickly as possible. Make sure you use
							farm accounts to spread the word in-game to avoid having your main
							blocked. FYI, any email with the word &quot;boycott&quot; will bounce on
							the in-game server.<br>
							<br>
							Please stress the importance of everyone holding out on buying so they
							take us seriously.<br>
							<br>
							This is a time to return to the simple pleasures of the game. For
							example: no core wonder fighting, no one gets burned in the radius of
							the forest that way everyone can keep on playing without spending and
							constantly resetting wonders. Each kingdom &amp; alliance can choose how
							they wish to participate in the boycott, in addition to not spending. Be
							creative, have fun with it.<br>
							<br>
							We will post the letter we&apos;re sending here for all to see, and keep
							everyone updated.<br>
							<br>
							Additionally, many of you have asked which figurehead will be leading
							the charge &amp; having these discussions with MZ. We&apos;ve spoke to a
							few of the top players and they are supporting the boycott. But as for
							figurehead, we have a legal representative that will speak on our
							behalf. We will stand together as a unified army against the madness. We
							have just as much value; our discontent with MZ is no less without a
							figurehead to act as a mouthpiece. We WILL stand against them! We WILL
							be heard!<br>

							💋💋αηɡεʆα💋💋: BOYCOTT List<br>
							Game of War (GOW)<br>
							<br>
							a. UPGRADES<br>
							&gt;Interval of releases<br>
							Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent
							releases are ridiculously fast making it so hard for everyone to keep
							up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave the game because they
							become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
							at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able
							to enjoy and maximize it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be
							out with at least 1 month interval so players can play with it longer.
							Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
							<br>
							Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features
							like dungeons, alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc
							to be more relevant and useful for everyone. Payouts or rewards must
							commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the upgrades.<br>
							<br>
							Major SH releases:<br>
							June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem
							preset, Paladin of Sola Gear<br>
							<br>
							July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores
							(Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus, Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts,
							Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
							<br>
							August - Graveyard upgrade<br>
							<br>
							September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
							<br>
							October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							Business Effect:<br>
							Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the
							upgrades are lost business. They are mostly players spending in the game
							regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means longer revenue from
							that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Cost<br>
							The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling
							the burnt in their pockets. This too discourages players. If only
							upgrades would require just a couple of packs instead of 10s or 100s
							pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
							more active<br>
							<br>
							b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
							&gt;Lags<br>
							Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which
							annoy players, especially during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where
							lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play smoothly, it also
							costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
							eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up,
							multiple buttons in joining rallies, etc.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Glitches<br>
							Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months
							such as tile porting, heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on
							and off VIP, etc. These glitches are irritating and at the same times
							costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example, to VIP 24
							only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;App Crash<br>
							Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally
							eliminated.<br>
							<br>
							Business effect:<br>
							If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The
							more active the game is, the more revenue for MZ as players will
							purchase items they need for the event.<br>
							<br>
							c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
							&gt;More responsive<br>
							Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address
							concerns. Sadly, many mails are ignored for days. Mails must be answered
							within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner service agent.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Quality of response<br>
							Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate
							players in full who suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a
							fraction of what was lost actually just give a feeling of insults or
							irritates players.<br>
							<br>
							d. EVENTS<br>
							&gt;Interval and duration<br>
							Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it
							only happens every 2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making
							it more frequent like weekly and in longer duration like 24hrs to cover
							players from different timezones<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Coliseum events<br>
							Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought
							with gold, loyalty points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for
							different power levels must be returned so that even small players can
							enjoy the event.<br>
							<br>
							Business Effect:<br>
							Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for
							kvk. Giving more events will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
							<br>
							e. PACKS<br>
							&gt;Content<br>
							Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most
							packs are outdated. Items that are in demand and highly needed are often
							than not absent in packs. Why not remove chests and items that are
							outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing orbs,
							heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Price<br>
							Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger
							pack.<br>
							<br>
							f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
							&gt;Drops<br>
							Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or
							materials that are new and in demand.<br>
							<br>
							OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
							&gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
							The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made
							useful. The bazaar in particular should enable players to trade items
							between themselves. Copper should be varying or increasing. Items that
							can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
							should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock,
							instant execution, etc.<br>
							<br>
							-There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP
							pts. And the likes; 2) combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and
							other boosts.<br>
							<br>
							-Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom
							if it is staying for more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
							<br>
							-Alliance tile<br>
							Bring back the good gifts BOYCOTT List<br>
							Game of War (GOW)<br>
							<br>
							a. UPGRADES<br>
							&gt;Interval of releases<br>
							Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent
							releases are ridiculously fast making it so hard for everyone to keep
							up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave the game because they
							become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
							at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able
							to enjoy and maximize it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be
							out with at least 1 month interval so players can play with it longer.
							Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
							<br>
							Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features
							like dungeons, alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc
							to be more relevant and useful for everyone. Payouts or rewards must
							commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the upgrades.<br>
							<br>
							Major SH releases:<br>
							June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem
							preset, Paladin of Sola Gear<br>
							<br>
							July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores
							(Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus, Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts,
							Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
							<br>
							August - Graveyard upgrade<br>
							<br>
							September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
							<br>
							October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							Business Effect:<br>
							Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the
							upgrades are lost business. They are mostly players spending in the game
							regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means longer revenue from
							that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Cost<br>
							The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling
							the burnt in their pockets. This too discourages players. If only
							upgrades would require just a couple of packs instead of 10s or 100s
							pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
							more active<br>
							<br>
							b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
							&gt;Lags<br>
							Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which
							annoy players, especially during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where
							lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play smoothly, it also
							costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
							eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up,
							multiple buttons in joining rallies, etc.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Glitches<br>
							Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months
							such as tile porting, heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on
							and off VIP, etc. These glitches are irritating and at the same times
							costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example, to VIP 24
							only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;App Crash<br>
							Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally
							eliminated.<br>
							<br>
							Business effect:<br>
							If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The
							more active the game is, the more revenue for MZ as players will
							purchase items they need for the event.<br>
							<br>
							c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
							&gt;More responsive<br>
							Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address
							concerns. Sadly, many mails are ignored for days. Mails must be answered
							within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner service agent.<br>
							<br>
							&gt;Quality of response<br>
							Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate
							players in full who suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a
							fraction of what was lost actually just give a feeling of insults or
							irritates players.<br>
							<br>
							d. EVENTS<br>
							&gt;Interval and duration<br>
							Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it
							only happens every 2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making
							it more frequent like weekly and in longer duration like 24hrs to cover
							players from different timezones<br>

							with gold, loyalty points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for
							different power levels must be returned so that even small players can
							enjoy the event.<br>

							Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for
							kvk. Giving more events will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>

							Lizzie 😍[#HAM]: 🚨Boycott Update🚨<br>
							<br>
							A spending boycott is planned to go into effect on Sunday, October 23 at
							midnight PST.<br>
							<br>
							The initial boycott will last for 2 days (48 hours). We will keep
							everyone informed of the progress in opening a channel for discussion
							with MZ. If need be, we may have further boycotting to drive home our
							stance on our topics.<br>
							<br>
							Please help us spread the word as quickly as possible. Make sure you use
							farm accounts to spread the word in-game to avoid having your main
							blocked. FYI, any email with the word &quot;boycott&quot; will bounce on
							the in-game server.<br>
							<br>
							Please stress the importance of everyone holding out on buying so they
							take us seriously.<br>
							<br>
							This is a time to return to the simple pleasures of the game. For
							example: no core wonder fighting, no one gets burned in the radius of
							the forest that way everyone can keep on playing without spending and
							constantly resetting wonders. Each kingdom &amp; alliance can choose how
							they wish to participate in the boycott, in addition to not spending. Be
							creative, have fun with it.<br>
							<br>
							We will post the letter we&apos;re sending here for all to see, and keep
							everyone updated.<br>
							<br>
							Additionally, many of you have asked which figurehead will be leading
							the charge &amp; having these discussions with MZ. We&apos;ve spoke to a
							few of the top players and they are supporting the boycott. But as for
							figurehead, we have a legal representative that will speak on our
							behalf. We will stand together as a unified army against the madness. We
							have just as much value; our discontent with MZ is no less without a
							figurehead to act as a mouthpiece. We WILL stand against them! We WILL
							be heard!<br>
							<br>
							Thank you!<br>
