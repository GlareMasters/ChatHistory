                        Fiery Phoenix: BOYCOTT List<br>
                        Game of War (GOW)<br>
                        <br>
                        a. UPGRADES<br>
                        &gt;Interval of releases<br>
                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>
                        <br>
                        Major SH releases:<br>
                        June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem preset, Paladin of Sola
                        Gear<br>
                        <br>
                        July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores (Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus,
                        Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts, Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
                        <br>
                        August - Graveyard upgrade<br>
                        <br>
                        September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address concerns. Sadly, many mails
                        are ignored for days. Mails must be answered within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner
                        service agent.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,

                        have complained at some point about mz. So what&apos;s the big problem with giving it a shot.
                        Everyone is soooo concerned with if it will work or being a Debbie downer and saying it
                        won&apos;t work. Seriously??? My thinking is if you do nothing you have no right to bitch. So
                        I&apos;m thinking why the hell not?!?! Let me boycott if it doesn&apos;t work... What? I either
                        stop playing or I play just like I was before. If it works, yay!!! So seriously guys,
                        let&apos;s quit bitching and doing nothing.<br>

                        <br>
                        A spending boycott is planned to go into effect on Sunday, October 23 at midnight PST.<br>
                        <br>
                        The initial boycott will last for 2 days (48 hours). We will keep everyone informed of the
                        progress in opening a channel for discussion with MZ. If need be, we may have further
                        boycotting to drive home our stance on our topics.<br>
                        <br>
                        Please help us spread the word as quickly as possible. Make sure you use farm accounts to
                        spread the word in-game to avoid having your main blocked. FYI, any email with the word
                        &quot;boycott&quot; will bounce on the in-game server.<br>
                        <br>
                        Please stress the importance of everyone holding out on buying so they take us seriously.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is a time to return to the simple pleasures of the game. For example: no core wonder
                        fighting, no one gets burned in the radius of the forest that way everyone can keep on playing
                        without spending and constantly resetting wonders. Each kingdom &amp; alliance can choose how
                        they wish to participate in the boycott, in addition to not spending. Be creative, have fun
                        with it.<br>
                        <br>
                        We will post the letter we&apos;re sending here for all to see, and keep everyone updated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, many of you have asked which figurehead will be leading the charge &amp; having
                        these discussions with MZ. We&apos;ve spoke to a few of the top players and they are supporting
                        the boycott. But as for figurehead, we have a legal representative that will speak on our
                        behalf. We will stand together as a unified army against the madness. We have just as much
                        value; our discontent with MZ is no less without a figurehead to act as a mouthpiece. We WILL
                        stand against them! We WILL be heard!<br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you!<br>

                        And since they started mobile strike the ke events we had every weekend stoped with no

                        also shows us where there priorities lay now. Mobile strike is there new toy we are the old
                        game there comfortable with as it is so now they don&apos;t focus on it like they used to

                        DeezBigONutz: The practice of high prices on a product when it first releases is something
                        thats practiced by almost all products purchased. Early spenders pay the initial jump costs for
                        all the expenditures needed to design, research, create, and mass produce a product.<br>
                        <br>
                        The problem is that MZ has created only a game platform, they have very little overhead - their
                        product costs nothing to produce - yet they give absolutely nothing to its customer base. For
                        instance, the cheap packs are cheap because they contain less than the divisor of the 99 dollar
                        pack. You aren&apos;t getting a bargain<br>

                        disposable, I do understand the struggle for fairness here from the loyal players but at the
                        end of the day it&apos;s just a very expensive game to play and not really worth it to continue
                        playing. Mz will go as far as they want with the game.<br>

                        &gt;Interval of releases<br>
                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>
                        <br>
                        Major SH releases:<br>
                        June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem preset, Paladin of Sola
                        Gear<br>
                        <br>
                        July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores (Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus,
                        Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts, Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>

                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>

                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>

                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>

                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>

                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>

                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>

                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>

                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>

                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>

                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>

                        &gt;Interval of releases<br>
                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>

                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the

                        Critical gear sets are often offered to new accounts at low prices (Prospectors, Blacksmith,
                        Salvagers). But mid-range and older accounts cannot build or get mats for these gears for love
                        or money and have spent THOUSANDS putting them together. (Personally, I&apos;ve spent a grand
                        on Prospector and still lack the last of the 7 set. I bought a 5 set for my farm for
                        $9.99.)This is a critical problem for millions of players.<br>

                        Harriet: 🚨Boycott Update🚨<br>
                        <br>
                        A spending boycott is planned to go into effect on Sunday, October 23 at midnight PST.<br>
                        <br>
                        The initial boycott will last for 2 days (48 hours). We will keep everyone informed of the
                        progress in opening a channel for discussion with MZ. If need be, we may have further
                        boycotting to drive home our stance on our topics.<br>
                        <br>
                        Please help us spread the word as quickly as possible. Make sure you use farm accounts to
                        spread the word in-game to avoid having your main blocked. FYI, any email with the word
                        &quot;boycott&quot; will bounce on the in-game server.<br>
                        <br>
                        Please stress the importance of everyone holding out on buying so they take us seriously.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is a time to return to the simple pleasures of the game. For example: no core wonder
                        fighting, no one gets burned in the radius of the forest that way everyone can keep on playing
                        without spending and constantly resetting wonders. Each kingdom &amp; alliance can choose how
                        they wish to participate in the boycott, in addition to not spending. Be creative, have fun
                        with it.<br>
                        <br>
                        We will post the letter we&apos;re sending here for all to see, and keep everyone updated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, many of you have asked which figurehead will be leading the charge &amp; having
                        these discussions with MZ. We&apos;ve spoke to a few of the top players and they are supporting
                        the boycott. But as for figurehead, we have a legal representative that will speak on our
                        behalf. We will stand together as a unified army against the madness. We have just as much
                        value; our discontent with MZ is no less without a figurehead to act as a mouthpiece. We WILL
                        stand against them! We WILL be heard!<br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you!<br>

                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>

                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address concerns. Sadly, many mails
                        are ignored for days. Mails must be answered within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner
                        service agent.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        -There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP pts. And the likes; 2)
                        combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and other boosts.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom if it is staying for
                        more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Alliance tile<br>
                        Bring back the good gifts from alliance tiles as players spend on cores and troops to defend
                        it.<br>

                        complaining about the inability of people who don&apos;t spend much to get a set vs the ability
                        of people who spend a LOT to get a set. Rather, exactly the opposite. I was grousing that
                        someone who has spent a fair bit (almost $7000 to date, maybe not as much as some, certainly
                        not chump change) cannot even finish the Prospector&apos;s 7 set, while I can easily buy the
                        same 5 set in my farm for $9.99.<br>
                        <br>
                        It&apos;s not spend a lot and get the set. It&apos;s spend nothing and get the set, but spend a
                        LOT and NOT be able to get the set. We who have shelled out in the $$$$ should be able to
                        finish our god damned sets!!!<br>

                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>
                        <br>
                        Major SH releases:<br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address concerns. Sadly, many mails
                        are ignored for days. Mails must be answered within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner
                        service agent.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        -There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP pts. And the likes; 2)
                        combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and other boosts.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom if it is staying for
                        more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Alliance tile<br>
                        Bring back the good gifts from alliance tiles as players spend on cores and troops to defend
                        it.<br>

                        couldn&apos;t before... But it seems to be the same game cores cost... If I was in it to attack
                        everyone I&apos;d be upset that something new came right after I got the first... (laugh) and
                        if you don&apos;t spend close to 1k when new gear comes out you can&apos;t get it until they
                        give it to the littles for almost nothing.. I just decided to wait until they give it away...
                        (laugh)<br>

                        Game of War (GOW)<br>
                        <br>
                        a. UPGRADES<br>
                        &gt;Interval of releases<br>
                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>
                        <br>
                        Major SH releases:<br>
                        June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem preset, Paladin of Sola
                        Gear<br>
                        <br>
                        July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores (Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus,
                        Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts, Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
                        <br>
                        August - Graveyard upgrade<br>
                        <br>
                        September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address concerns. Sadly, many mails
                        are ignored for days. Mails must be answered within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner
                        service agent.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        -There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP pts. And the likes; 2)
                        combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and other boosts.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom if it is staying for

                        that counts the clicks. The macro bot will then show what team won in that room.<br>
                        <br>
                        They are calling it the &quot;Cleansing of the Public Toilets&quot;<br>

                        💋💋αηɡεʆα💋💋: BOYCOTT List<br>
                        Game of War (GOW)<br>
                        <br>
                        a. UPGRADES<br>
                        &gt;Interval of releases<br>
                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>
                        <br>
                        Major SH releases:<br>
                        June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem preset, Paladin of Sola
                        Gear<br>
                        <br>
                        July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores (Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus,
                        Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts, Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
                        <br>
                        August - Graveyard upgrade<br>
                        <br>
                        September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address concerns. Sadly, many mails
                        are ignored for days. Mails must be answered within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner
                        service agent.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        -There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP pts. And the likes; 2)
                        combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and other boosts.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom if it is staying for
                        more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Alliance tile<br>
                        Bring back the good gifts from alliance tiles as players spend on cores and troops to defend
                        it.<br>

                        Game upgrades are good as it reinvents the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards must commensurate with or a fraction of the demands of the
                        upgrades.<br>

                        September - Cores (Bacchus), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice), garrison, sh24 buildings<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. Enough upgrade pacing means
                        longer revenue from that upgrade and longer life span for the game.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players. If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs
                        instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the
                        more active<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag has improved a bit from last year. But there is still lags, which annoy players, especially
                        during events like SW, coliseum or kvk where lag is worst. Aside from hindering players to play
                        smoothly, it also costs money. Many players won&apos;t join events due to lag. Why not
                        eliminate other unnecessary steps to prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in
                        joining rallies, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same times costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business effect:<br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Players send letter with the hope that MZ will respond and address concerns. Sadly, many mails
                        are ignored for days. Mails must be answered within 24hrs not by autoreply but real custoner
                        service agent.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insults or irritates players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game. Yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Coliseums for different power levels must be returned so
                        that even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Business Effect:<br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spender, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more events
                        will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated.
                        Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not remove
                        chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs, blessing
                        orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and update too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        -There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP pts. And the likes; 2)
                        combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and other boosts.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom if it is staying for
                        more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Alliance tile<br>
                        Bring back the good gifts from alliance tiles as players spend on cores and troops to defend
                        it.<br>

                        Fiery Phoenix: BOYCOTT List<br>
                        Game of War (GOW)<br>
                        <br>
                        a. UPGRADES<br>
                        &gt;Interval of releases<br>
                        Game upgrades are good as they reinvent the game. However, the recent releases are ridiculously
                        fast making it so hard for everyone to keep up. Many players regardless of size chose to leave
                        the game because they become obsolete after a week of spending and upgrading. There should be
                        at least 3 MONTHS INTERVAL between releases so that players will be able to enjoy and maximize
                        it before the next upgrade. Core updates must be out with at least 1 month interval so players
                        can play with it longer. Fast-paced upgrades choke the players.<br>
                        <br>
                        Too many game upgrades yet forgetting to upgrade other old game features like dungeons,
                        alliance store, bazaar, secret gifts, quest payouts, etc. to be more relevant and useful for
                        everyone. Payouts or rewards coming these old features must commensurate with or a fraction of
                        the upgrade requirements.<br>
                        <br>
                        Major SH releases are listed below to show how choking they are:<br>
                        June (7) - VIP 22, Cores (Nike, Apollo), March 14, Sh23 buildings, Gem preset, Paladin of Sola
                        Gear<br>
                        <br>
                        July (10) - Sh23 buildings, Battle markings, March 15, Cores (Hephaestus), Gears (Colossus,
                        Oracle), VIP23, 175% March size boosts, Speed up treasury, Hero 61-65<br>
                        <br>
                        August - Graveyard upgrade, Banners<br>
                        <br>
                        September - Cores (Bacchus, hera), gear workshop, Sh24 buildings, hidden researches in Academy
                        24, gear (Exalted Gear)<br>
                        <br>
                        October - hero 70, Cores (Lady Justice, Perses), garrison, sh24 buildings, gears (Skeleton,
                        supreme marshal)<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Players who wanted to play longer but are discouraged due to the upgrades are lost business.
                        They are mostly players spending in the game regardless of amount. If MZ will have enough
                        pacing on the upgrades, players will be happy to pick it up and spend as they feel the need for
                        new challenges in the game. Rather than choke them with weekly upgrades. This also means longer
                        revenue for each upgrade.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Cost of upgrades<br>
                        The cost of each upgrade is too much that even big spenders are feeling the burnt in their
                        pockets. This too discourages players thinking, &quot;I just upgraded and spent this much $$$
                        to max, yet here I am after few days, not maxed. I would need this much again this week to
                        max.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        If only upgrades would require just a couple of packs instead of 10s or 100s pack, then players
                        will be more happy. The more players can upgrade, the more active the game will be. The more
                        new players will be interested.<br>
                        <br>
                        b. SYSTEM/SERVER ISSUES<br>
                        &gt;Lags<br>
                        Lag annoys players as it costs them money and also hinders their game. Lag is worst during
                        events like SW, coliseum or kvk and these are the most liked features of the game. Whenever the
                        game is laggy, many players won&apos;t play. If this basic element of the game is fixed, more
                        players will be encouraged to join events. Why not eliminate other unnecessary steps/clicks to
                        prevent lags like warrant pop-up, multiple buttons in joining rallies, etc. Also get rid of old
                        and low stats cores, pcs, materials that take up space in the server. Maybe, exchange them for
                        orbs or essences.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Glitches<br>
                        Too many glitches in the game that haven&apos;t been fixed for months such as tile porting,
                        heroless, skill preset, core not registering, on and off VIP, etc. These glitches are
                        irritating and at the same time costs so much money. It costs so much to upgrade, fir example,
                        to VIP 24 only to have it glitched (on and off) and waste cores.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;App Crash<br>
                        Game crashes especially during events must be minimal, if not totally eliminated.<br>
                        <br>
                        If lags and glitches are addressed, more players will join events. The more active the game is,
                        the more revenue for MZ as players will purchase items they need for the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        c. CUSTOMER SERVICE<br>
                        &gt;More responsive<br>
                        Responses to mails must be within 24hrs depending on the gameplay effect of the issue.
                        Categorize concerns based on severity and urgency. Technical issues must be top priorities.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Quality of response<br>
                        Complaints on glitches can be validated in your logs. Why not compensate players in full who
                        suffered from the glitches? Compensating us with a fraction of what was lost actually just give
                        a feeling of insult that irate players.<br>
                        <br>
                        d. EVENTS<br>
                        &gt;Interval and duration<br>
                        Kvk is one of the most anticipated and enjoyed parts of the game yet it only happens every
                        2-3wks. This makes players bored in the game. Making it more frequent like weekly and in longer
                        duration like 24hrs to cover players from different timezones will actually make players happy
                        and more active.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Coliseum events<br>
                        Ports for the coliseum event must be earned from infernos and/or bought with gold, loyalty
                        points or copper not just in packs. Open other coliseums for different power levels so that
                        even small players can enjoy the event.<br>
                        <br>
                        Players, whether small, medium or big spenders, spend in preparation for kvk. Giving more
                        events will encourage them to spend and grow.<br>
                        <br>
                        e. PACKS<br>
                        &gt;Content<br>
                        Current packs are a lot better than last year. However, contents in most packs are outdated
                        already. Items that are in demand and highly needed are often than not absent in packs. Why not
                        remove chests and items that are outdated and replace them with new ones like time orbs,
                        blessing orbs, heroic medals, gems, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        &gt;Price<br>
                        Put ancient advanced teleport in $5-$20 or increase numbers in bigger pack.<br>
                        Strike a balance on packs. Make it relevant based on needs and do not take out item without
                        replacing them i.e. packs for maxed account.<br>
                        <br>
                        f. MONSTERS AND TILES<br>
                        &gt;Drops<br>
                        Make drops from monsters relevant and updated too. Gems, pcs, cores or materials that are new
                        and in demand.<br>
                        <br>
                        OTHER SUGGESTIONS:<br>
                        &gt;Alliance City-Bazaar<br>
                        The alliance city is a nice adornment in the game but it should be made useful. The bazaar in
                        particular should enable players to trade items between themselves. Copper should be varying or
                        increasing. Items that can be sold and bought must be replaced/updated 2x or once a month. It
                        should also sell relevant items like heroic medals, orbs, 45min hemlock, instant execution,
                        etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        -There should be feature like 1) one button to use all hero xp and VIP pts. And the likes; 2)
                        combine lower march size boosts, rss boosts and other boosts.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Make home ports useful by enabling players to choose a new home kingdom if it is staying for
                        more than a month in a new kingdom.<br>
                        <br>
                        -Alliance tile<br>
                        Bring back the good gifts from alliance tiles as players spend on cores and troops to defend
                        it.<br>

                        1 Effin hedake: Hello,<br>
                        <br>
                        This message is regarding the application Game of War: Fire Age (GOW).<br>
                        <br>
                        As you may be aware GOW has a multiple kingdom layout in which these kingdoms are split into
                        two types; Ancient (Free to move between other ancient kingdoms) and Protected (Unable to move
                        between any kingdoms).<br>
                        <br>
                        We are currently situated in kingdoms with the Protected status, 767-849 to be exact. The last
                        kingdom to become Ancient was approximately 2 months ago. The kingdoms 767-849 are in that
                        range to go ancient (looking at previous kingdoms to go ancient).<br>
                        <br>
                        We have all continuously made contact with Machine Zone (MZ) to only receive copy and paste
                        replies with no guidance or real tether to what they respond with. MZ still profits heavily
                        from these kingdoms yet we are currently in a situation where they take money without any
                        consideration of our kingdoms.<br>
                        <br>
                        It should also be noted that MZ sold packs to us several months ago with ancient teleports
                        (teleports needed to move kingdoms) giving us false impression of going ancient.<br>
                        <br>
                        In fairness to players who populate the kingdoms in question we would like to be treated as all
                        other players in this game environment. We feel our spending on this application has become
                        fruitless at this point and the advancement of our status to Ancient Kingdoms would boost
                        activity and enhance the enjoyment of the game therefore promote greater spending for the
                        offered in app purchases.<br>
                        <br>
                        All contact with them has become untenable. We have come to yourselves in hope of you
                        understanding our predicament for what MZ is currently doing to us and that you can please do
                        what is needed to ensure we are treated fairly like other kingdoms and players in GOW.<br>
                        <br>
                        We apologise for the mass amount of identical mails regarding this, however we are at a loose
                        end with this situation that we find ourselves in, we hope you understand.<br>
                        <br>
